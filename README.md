Appointment 2 Services
======================

Sample Rails application that allows user to schedule services using pre-provided time slots

Visit the [demo](http://appointment2services.herokuapp.com/). You can use the default `admin@admin.org / admin` user to get access to the admin features, such as:

* CRUD Services
* CRUD Appointments
* Change Appointment status by clicking over it status name on index page

`All the appointments creation/changes are broadcasted to all interested users (admin/targeted user) via a Faye Server.`

This application is still under construction / refactoring, so if you wanna contribute I'll be glad for your help!
